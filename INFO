The TotalFreedomMod is a great plugin that you can either compile or just get the jar it was origally made for TotalFreedom
but you are welcome to use it for your own purposes it add's lots of great commands such as: /opall - Op's Everyone
But OPS cannot ban or rollback you must superadmin someone there are three kinds of admins Super Admin Super Telnet Admin
and Senior Admin 
Well That's All But Theres Lots More COmmands.
